# Pending_credit_card_approval

## 1. Credit card applications
<p>Commercial banks receive <em>a lot</em> of applications for credit cards. Many of them get rejected for many reasons, like high loan balances, low income levels, or too many inquiries on an individual's credit report, for example. Manually analyzing these applications is mundane, error-prone, and time-consuming (and time is money!). Luckily, this task can be automated with the power of machine learning and pretty much every commercial bank does so nowadays. In this notebook, we will build an automatic credit card approval predictor using machine learning techniques, just like the real banks do.</p>

<p>We'll use the <a href="http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/credit+approval">Credit Card Approval dataset</a> from the UCI Machine Learning Repository. The structure of this notebook is as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>First, we will start off by loading and viewing the dataset.</li>
<li>We will see that the dataset has a mixture of both numerical and non-numerical features, that it contains values from different ranges, plus that it contains a number of missing entries.</li>
<li>We will have to preprocess the dataset to ensure the machine learning model we choose can make good predictions.</li>
<li>After our data is in good shape, we will do some exploratory data analysis to build our intuitions.</li>
<li>Finally, we will build a machine learning model that can predict if an individual's application for a credit card will be accepted.</li>
</ul>
<p>First, loading and viewing the dataset. We find that since this data is confidential, the contributor of the dataset has anonymized the feature names.</p>

<p>We will evaluate our model on the test set with respect to <a href="https://developers.google.com/machine-learning/crash-course/classification/accuracy">classification accuracy</a>. But we will also take a look the model's <a href="http://www.dataschool.io/simple-guide-to-confusion-matrix-terminology/">confusion matrix</a>. In the case of predicting credit card applications, it is important to see if our machine learning model is equally capable of predicting approved and denied status, in line with the frequency of these labels in our original dataset. If our model is not performing well in this aspect, then it might end up approving the application that should have been approved. The confusion matrix helps us to view our model's performance from these aspects.  </p>

## 2. Finding the best performing model
<p>We have defined the grid of hyperparameter values and converted them into a single dictionary format which <code>GridSearchCV()</code> expects as one of its parameters. Now, we will begin the grid search to see which values perform best.</p>
<p>We will instantiate <code>GridSearchCV()</code> with our earlier <code>logreg</code> model with all the data we have. We will also instruct <code>GridSearchCV()</code> to perform a <a href="https://www.dataschool.io/machine-learning-with-scikit-learn/">cross-validation</a> of five folds.</p>
<p>We'll end the notebook by storing the best-achieved score and the respective best parameters.</p>
<p>While building this credit card predictor, we tackled some of the most widely-known preprocessing steps such as <strong>scaling</strong>, <strong>label encoding</strong>, and <strong>missing value imputation</strong>. We finished with some <strong>machine learning</strong> to predict if a person's application for a credit card would get approved or not given some information about that person.</p>
